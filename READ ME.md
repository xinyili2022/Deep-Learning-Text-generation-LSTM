This is  the midterm project for STAT 6289 course, which is about the text generation using LSTM model.

It is the modified version of a project, and the source code is https://github.com/adibyte95/Text-Generation-using-LSTM/blob/master/text_generation_prog.ipynb

(Simplied dataset)Text_generation_using_LSTM.ipynb and Text_generation_using_LSTM.ipynb attached in the repositories are both modified notebook. **If the code plagiarism is needed, the file (Simplied dataset)Text_generation_using _LSTM.ipynb is perferred**. 

The main difference of the two notebooks is that they are using different dataset. I deleted some chapters of the original dataset, wonderland.txt, to creat a smaller dataset, wonderland_simplied.txt. Although I found the simplied version might not be accessible to predicte after running the codes, it could still show that larger dataset is neccessary to generate text via LSTM and how it would look like when we use smaller dataset.

Thank you for reading!
