This is  the midterm project for STAT 6289 course, which is about the text generation using LSTM model.

It is the modified version of a project, and the source code is https://github.com/adibyte95/Text-Generation-using-LSTM/blob/master/text_generation_prog.ipynb

If the code plagiarism is needed, the file *(Simplied dataset)Text_generation_using _LSTM.ipynb* is perferred. The main difference of the two ipynb notebooks is that they are using different dataset. The simplied dataset is organized by deleted some chapters of the original dataset, wonderland.txt. However, after running the code, I found the simplied version could be predicted the text. It could still be used in testing code plagiarism. Thank you!
